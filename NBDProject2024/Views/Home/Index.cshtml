This is going to be the First Page that you will be using when a client comes in with a new project. From here you will be able to create the profile for a new client or find an existing client profile on the client to add the project to, and once that is done you will be able to create the project for the client right away from a link already provided to redirect you to the project(s) page, for efficiency purposes.</p>
